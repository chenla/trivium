* Introduction

This keeps cropping up so much, in so many different places that it
deserves its own file.

We as individuals and we as a modern civilization take credit for
knowing far more than we do.  In fact, what we do know, is the tinest
of crumbs compared to the barn-sized loaf of what we don't.  And even
that crumb, if not constantly maintained would eventually dry out and
turn to dust.
