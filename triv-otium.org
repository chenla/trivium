* Introduction

Beyond the three /subjects/ of the Trivium there is no practical
methodology or philosophy about how to live and work.  The
intellectual tools that the Trivium gives us must be matched by a
daily workflow that is product and sustainable -- these two concepts
are embodied in Mastery and Otium.
