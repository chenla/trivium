The Chenla Trivium is the foundation for learning to become a
continuous process that is woven through out lives from cradle to

* Introduction

The Trivium prepares the mind to learn through directed and self
directed study, to reason and think critically, and to organize ones
thoughts and communicate them.  The Trivium provides the skills and
tools to study the Quadrivium.

The Quadrivium is provides the context needed to orient the mind and
understand who, what, where, when, how and why.  What are we, where
are we, how did we get here, where are we going, what has happened,
how does everything fit together etc.
