** Introduction

It's only been very recently that Rest/Otium have started to
get any attention.  But we also need treat /negotium/ as
equally important in its own way.  Negotium  is our public
life, how we craft a persona that shapes how we are
percieved.  Interacting with the world is no mean feat.  And
for introverts and borderline recluses like my self, is an
enormous challenge.

Some things to look into:

  - Paul Graham's Maker & Manager Hours
  - Correspondance :: look at how others do it -- and always use
                      asynchronous communication.
  - Networking  :: building and maintaining relationships with people,
                   how to keep in touch, how to use them
  - Mentorship  :: always finding time to teach
  - Delegation  :: very hard for some -- for me!
  - Speaking    :: 
  - Publishing  ::
  - Interviews  ::
  - Social Media
    - Blogging
    - Discussion Threads
  - Family
  - Friends
  - Travel
  - Money
  - Maintenance :: mechanics of health, chores, errands and other
                   things that aren't part of Otium
