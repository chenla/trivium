* John Coltrane

Need to track down this story, but I remember reading, on an album
cover for some Coltrane Bluenote album (I think) the the story of when
the author was a young man, learning to play the Sax, having met
Coltrane after a show.  Coltrane asked him if he wanted to practice
with him the next day.  The young man showed up with with his
instrument at the hotel room the next day and was completely blown
away when all Coltrane played through the entire practice was several
hours of scales!  That's it, no songs or themes or riffs or solos --
just scales...

You could say that scales are for musicians, what a block of marble is
for a sculptor -- they contain all music.

* Review articles

#+begin_quote
Not to be confused with a “peer reviewed journal,” Review
articles are an attempt by one or more writers to sum up the
current state of the research on a particular
topic. Ideally, the writer searches for everything relevant
to the topic, and then sorts it all out into a coherent view
of the “state of the art” as it now stands. Review Articles
will teach you about::

   - the main people working in a field
   - recent major advances and discoveries
   - significant gaps in the research
   - current debates
   - ideas of where research might go next

Review Articles are virtual gold mines if you want to find
out what the key articles are for a given topic. If you read
and thoroughly digest a good review article, you should be
able to “talk the talk” about a given topic. Unlike research
articles, review articles are good places to get a basic
idea about a topic.
