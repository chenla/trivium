* Introduction

Mastery is the process of lifelong learning.  The Trivium can be thought of
as a means of establishing underlying habits of thought and technique
that are part of the process of mastering any skill or subject.  As
such Mastery is a unspoken subject of the Trivium that is not formally
given a name but is taught indirectly.

This doesn't mean that Mastery is an un-spoken process.  The process
of mastering a subject or skill is well known.  It is not an easy
process, and there are no short-cuts, but it is deeply fulfilling.  In
many respects Mastery is the foundation that civilization is built on.


Mastery comes down to three things:

   - knowledge
   - technique
   - process


Mastery: George Leonard

5 keys to long-term success:

  - Instruction;
  - Practice;
  - Surrender;
  - Intentionality; and,
  - The Edge - Push the envelop.

Mastery is:

  - The process where what was difficult becomes both easier and
    more pleasurable;
  - Long-term dedication to the journey - not the bottom line;
  - Gaining mental discipline to travel further on your journey;
  - Being goalless;
  - Realizing that the pleasure of practice is intensified;
  - Creating deep roots;
  - Knowing that you will never reach a final destination;
  - Being diligent with the process of mastery;
  - Your commitment to hone your skills;
  - After you have reached the top of the mountain, climb
    another one;
  - Being willing to practice, even when you seem to be getting
    no where;
  - Making this a life process;
  - Being patient, while you apply long-term efforts;
  - Appreciating and even enjoying the plateau, as much as you do
    the progress;
  - Practicing for the sake of practice;
  - Winning graciously, and losing with equal grace;
  - Placing practice, discipline, conditioning and character
    development before winning;
  - Being courageous;
  - Being fully in the present moment;
  - Realizing that the ultimate goal is not the medal, or the
    ribbon, but the path to mastery its self (The "I am" stage);
  - Being willing to look foolish;
  - Maintaining flexibility in your strategy, and in your
    actions;
  - A journey; and,
  - Determination

Shallow Work: “Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style
tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend
to not create much new value in the world and are easy to
replicate.”

Deep Work: “Professional activities performed in a state of
distraction-free concentration that push you cognitive
capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value,
improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”
